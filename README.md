# 🧹 Code Quality Setup

To maintain high code quality and developer experience, this project incorporates the following tools:

## 🔵 ESLint 9 + FlatConfig

- Configured using the latest ESLint FlatConfig format.
- Managed via `.eslint.config.mjs`.
- Plugins included:
  - `eslint-plugin-unicorn` (modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices)
  - `eslint-plugin-import` (import order and duplicate checking)
  - `eslint-plugin-unused-imports` (detect and remove unused imports)
  - `eslint-plugin-tsdoc` (TypeScript documentation comment syntax checking)

Run lint check:

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## 🕓 Prettier

- Code formatting is enforced by Prettier.
- Configured via `.prettier.config.cjs`.
- Integrated with ESLint to report formatting issues as warnings.

Check formatting:

```bash
npx prettier --check .
```

Automatically fix formatting:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

---

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions (CI)

Automated checks are triggered on every pull request:

- ESLint code analysis
- Prettier formatting check
- Run tests (`npm run test`)
- Build confirmation (`npm run build`)

CI configuration file: `.github/workflows/lint.yml`

# 📖 Additional Notes

- It is recommended to run `npm run lint` locally before committing.
- Consistent coding style and quality improve code reviews and overall development efficiency.

Let's build high-quality and maintainable software together! 🚀
